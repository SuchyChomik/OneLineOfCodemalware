Batch: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a4de8f08d510781a9640cd20e46d0f643a9cd27b766b64b1892099b8d48be925?nocache=1  
EXE: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0598216ffc5e997cb0f4eb611413baba131538fbbcccdda0d5a8a227ff20709d?nocache=1  
somehow no av's detects the batch version  
also virus total says "The code is a one-line script that takes ownership of the drivers folder, removes the system folder, and ejects the C drive. This could be used to gain control of a system and install malware." about the batch version. It is actually true.
